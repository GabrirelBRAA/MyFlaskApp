        In software engineering, the terms frontend and backend (sometimes written as back end or back-end) refer to the separation of concerns between the presentation layer (frontend), and the data access layer (backend) of a piece of software, or the physical infrastructure or hardware. In the clientâ€“server model, the client is usually considered the frontend and the server is usually considered the backend, even when some presentation work is actually done on the server itself.
